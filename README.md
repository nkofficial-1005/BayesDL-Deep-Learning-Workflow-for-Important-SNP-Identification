##  Abstract

Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) is the discovery of  an association between certain variations in the genetic code (genome) and a certain physical trait (phenotype). Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant form of common simple DNA variants. In bioinformatics studies, one of the most challenging processes to carry out association tests is finding significant SNPs in high-dimensional data. This problem can be potentially solved by feature selection using statistical and machine learning algorithms. A Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) based workflow, BayesDL, is proposed to identify important SNPs. BayesDL is a cascaded classifier and regressor of an Artificial neural network using Bayesian inference. The model is fitted using R and Stan. Firstly, the whole-genome SNP data undergoes preliminary feature (SNP) selection using hypothesis testing procedures to reduce the size of the data. It is needed to make the data compatible with neural network (NN) architectures (especially BNN which also includes probabilistic distributions) as they require extensive computational resources (more than 32GB RAM when using all SNPs as input layer). Secondly, the BNN model is defined using Stan; the defined model is further used for SNP identification and test performance evaluation. Finally, the existing CNN model is utilized for comparison based on test performance metrics which aids in determining the superiority of BayesDL. The final output (important SNPs) from BayesDL is used for further biological analysis. The following paragraphs provide steps followed to perform preliminary feature selection and define the research work required to train and validate the NN-based models.

BayesDL, used for SNP identification, increases confidence in the selected SNPs by leveraging Bayesian methods and deep learning advantages. Also, by providing evidence against the hypothesis that apriori SNPs are insignificant, the proposed workflow aids in increasing confidence in the selected set of SNPs. Unlike a CNN model, which uses a single value for the weights, BayesDL accounts for the uncertainty of those weights by using probabilistic distribution, thereby improving the confidence in the chosen SNP set. Additionally, using BayesDL is beneficial when working with small sample sizes, as it helps to reduce over-fitting, a common issue evident in CNN. Using the BNN model also results in less number of False negatives as compared to that when using CNN.

## Prerequisites

Software: R Version 4.2.2 and R Version 3.6.3

Operating Systems: Linux 5.4.0-135-generic x86_64 and Linux 5.4.0-150-generic x86_64

###  Data

Arabidopsis thaliana  data, AtPolyDB, is used for this study. It is obtained from the easygwas website: https://easygwas.ethz.ch/data/public/dataset/view/1/. The AtPolyDB dataset has 1307 samples with 214051 SNPs (or features) and the F1 data set has 372 samples with 204753 SNPs. The data set contains three files: (a) PED file, (b) PHENO file, and (c) MAP file. The chosen phenotypes had three different data types: (a) Binary (Anthocyanin), (b) Continuous (Width), and (c) Categorical (Germination Days).

##  Methodology

The new workflow includes below steps,

<b>Input:</b>  Genotype .ped file and Phenotype .pheno file  
1. Pre-process the data and perform feature selection using chi-square and ANOVA tests for categorical and continuous phenotypes respectively.
2. Split the data into training (50\%) and testing (50\%) folds.
3. Develop and specify the Stan model as follows: 
a. The RStan model is developed to form data, transformed data, parameters, function, transformed parameters, model, and generated quantities block. Save the files as nn_reg.stan and nn_class.stan for further analysis.  
b. Specify the stan models in R using nn_reg.stan and nn_class.stan files. Define a function to compile the stan model and get the desired output as follows:
	1. Define stan data in the function.  
	2. Call Stan's optimizing methods to obtain point estimates by optimizing the posterior for the model. 
	3. Call a Stan's NUTS sampler to draw posterior samples from the model.
4. Fit train and test sets (and vice-versa) in the function for training the model and making predictions using $2$ hidden layers with $50$ neurons in each layer respectively. 
5. Record the two test performance metrics for each phenotype from the optimization method.
6. Rank the input SNPs by generating the samples of weights (weights ranked in increasing value of CoV) corresponding to predictors using the sampling function.

<b>Output:</b>  The top $10$ significant SNPs for each phenotype.

2. Additionally, download both Stan files ([nn_reg.stan](https://github.com/nkofficial-1005/BayesDL-Deep-Learning-Workflow-for-Important-SNP-Identification/blob/main/nn_reg.stan) and [nn_class.stan](https://github.com/nkofficial-1005/BayesDL-Deep-Learning-Workflow-for-Important-SNP-Identification/blob/main/nn_class.stan)).

5. For both Arabidopsis thaliana data, follow the following instructions for identifying important SNPs.
   - In [PreliminaryFeatureSelection.R](https://github.com/nkofficial-1005/BayesDL-Deep-Learning-Workflow-for-Important-SNP-Identification/blob/main/PreliminaryFeatureSelection.R) file
     - Input the Genotype .ped file and Phenotype .pheno file using the following syntax.
      ```r
      Geno <- read.pedfile("genotype.ped")
      char.pheno <- read.table("phenotypes.pheno", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = " ")
      ```
      - Now, select the appropriate phenotype data type using the following syntax.
      ```r
      y <- matrix(char.pheno$Anthocyanin_22) #Change the phenotype accordingly
      ```
      - According to the data type of the phenotype, either run the Chi-square test or ANOVA using the following syntax.
     ```r
      # Get the chi-squared test for categorical/binary
     for(k in 1:d){
     	 tab = table(df_final[,k], df_final[,d])
         pvals[k] = chisq.test(tab)$p.value
     }
     #Anova test for continuous
     for(k in 1:d){
      pvals[k] = summary(aov(df_final[,d]~df_final[,k]))[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][1]} 
     ```
      - Save the filtered data of phenotypes as per the following code.
      ```r
      write.csv(df_new, "Antho.csv")
      ```
      - Split data in 50% training and 50% testing sets and save them for further analysis of Neural Networks.

     write.csv(y_test, "ytest_Antho.csv")
     write.csv(x_train, "XTrain_Antho.csv")
     write.csv(y_train, "ytrain_Antho.csv")
     ```
   - In [Regression_BayesDL.R](https://github.com/nkofficial-1005/BayesDL-Deep-Learning-Workflow-for-Important-SNP-Identification/blob/main/Regression_BayesDL.R) file
     - Import the saved data (both feature and response) using the ```r read.csv () ``` command.
     - Read the saved [nn_reg.stan](https://github.com/nkofficial-1005/BayesDL-Deep-Learning-Workflow-for-Important-SNP-Identification/blob/main/nn_reg.stan) file using the following command.
       ```r
       sm_reg <- stan_model("nn_reg.stan")
       ```
     - Run the code for the developed function, "fit_nn_reg".
     - Use the saved function to fit regression NN.
       ```r
       #Optimizing the model
       fit_opt <- fit_nn_reg(xTest, yTest, xTrain, yTrain, 2, 50, data, method = "optimize")

       #Sampling from the fitted model
       fit_nuts <- fit_nn_reg(xTrain, yTrain, xTest, yTest, 2, 50, method = "sampling",
                       chains = 4, cores = 4, iter = 2000, warmup=1000)
       ```
     - Save the fitted model for future use because running takes a while.
       ```r

       fit <-readRDS('stan_fit_width.rds')   
       ```
     - Follow the next few command lines to sample the weights and compute their Mean & Standard Deviation.
     - Compute the Coefficient of Variation (CoV) using the following syntax.
       ```r
       # Compute the variable importance measures

       ```
     - Finally, select the top 10 SNPs or adjust the parameter to any chosen number of SNPs.
       ```r
       top_vars <- names(var_imp)[1:10]
       ```
     - Save the selected SNPs and use the selected SNPs for MCMC Diagnosis as per the study requirements.
